Australian Car Price PredictionÂ¶
GOAL
The aim of this project is to use the given dataset to find insights about the data using Exploratory Data Analysis and create a model to predict prices of the cars. This is a beginners project that I have done to merely illustrate how the supervised machine learning models- Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor nad Gradient Boosting Regressor are implemented in a project. I have used several metrics like R2 Score,adjusted R-squared, root mean squared error, and mean absolute eror to evaluate each model and compare them to each other. The theory of linear regression is based on certain statistical assumptions. Before model fitting the models, I have checked these regression assumptions using the linear regression approach.

ABOUT THE DATA
This dataset contains the latest information on car prices in Australia for the year 2023. It covers various brands, models, types, and features of cars sold in the Australian market. It provides useful insights into the trends and factors influencing the car prices in Australia. The dataset includes information such as brand, year, model, car/suv, title, used/new, transmission, engine, drive type, fuel type, fuel consumption, kilometres, colour (exterior/interior), location, cylinders in engine, body type, doors, seats, and price. The dataset has over 16,000 records of car listings from various online platforms in Australia. Source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/australian-vehicle-price
